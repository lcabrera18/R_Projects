# Computational Linguistics PhD Project Projects Repository

This repository contains a series of projects that form a critical part of my doctoral research in Computational Linguistics. Explore the different stages of this multifaceted project:

## Stage 1: Data Collection 📚
**Description:** In the initial stage, I manually collected film scripts from over 65 films. For each script, I created parsers to extract essential information, including character names, dialogue lines, and stage directions.  

**Tools Used:** R (tidyr, dplyr, tibble, stringr) was employed for script parsing and data extraction.  

## Stage 2: Data Post-Processing 🧹
**Description:** This phase involved post-processing the collected data. I created character lists, enriched each film script with additional information such as character gender, year of release, and director. This information was sourced through a combination of film websites research and regular expressions in R.  

**Tools Used:** R libraries were utilized for data enrichment and post-processing.  

## Stage 3: Corpus Creation 📜
**Description:** All post-processed film scripts were combined to create a comprehensive corpus. This corpus formed the foundation for subsequent linguistic analysis.  

**Tools Used:** R was used for corpus creation and management.  

## Stage 4: Politeness Marker Extraction 🗣️
**Description:** In this stage, I applied the 'politeness' package to extract politeness markers from the film scripts. These markers were crucial for examining politeness strategies in dialogue.  

**Tools Used:** R and the 'politeness' package were employed for marker extraction.  

## Stage 5: Gendered Language Analysis 🚻
**Description:** Utilizing Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs), I investigated significant differences in the use of politeness markers between male and female characters while considering the gender of the listener, director, and screenwriter. The GLMM output was analyzed to draw insights on correlatiion among variables.  

**Tools Used:** R and GLMMs were used for the statistical analysis of gendered language.  

## Stage 6: Data Visualization 📊
**Description:** In the final stage, I visualized the results for politeness markers where significant differences were observed. Visualization played a key role in presenting the findings in an understandable and impactful manner.  

**Tools Used:** R was used for data visualization.
